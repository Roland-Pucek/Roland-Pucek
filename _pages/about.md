&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a research fellow in the Algebra group led by [Prof. Hendrik Süß](https://ibykus.sdf.org/website/) at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/institut-mathematik) of the University of Jena.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2023, I am  a member of two working groups, Cartan Geometry and Representation Theory, and Integrable Systems and Supersymmetry, in the COST Action CaLISTA.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did my PhD under the the supervision of Prof. David M. J. Calderbank, and defended my thesis, titled Extremal Kähler metrics and separable toric geometries, in February 2022.

Currently, I work on three projects.
In the field of extremal Kähler metrics, I study ... focus mostly on Kähler and Sasaki geometry with applications in extremal metrics.
Discrete geometry, geometry of compatible polytopes.
PDEs, integral representations of solutions.
