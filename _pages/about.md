I am a research fellow in the Algebra group led by [Prof. Dr. Hendrik Süß](https://ibykus.sdf.org/website/) at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/institut-mathematik) of the University of Jena. I am a differential geometer with interests in mathematics related to geometry. Currently, I focus mostly on Kähler and Sasaki geometry with applications in extremal metrics.

I did my PhD under the the supervision of Prof. David M. J. Calderbank, and defended my thesis, titled Extremal Kähler metrics and separable toric geometries, in November 2021.
